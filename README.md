# PortScanner
Personal Project Written while learning common cybersecurity scripts
written fully in python, 
It asks the console the IP or domain name it then uses socket to find the host IP.
It then runs through all ports of the given domain name and prints any open ports and prints it back to the user.
Tells the user when it is done scanning. 
Below is a screeshot of what it would look like running on youtube.com
